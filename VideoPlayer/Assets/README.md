## Required Assets for WinUI 3 App

When packaging the application, you'll need to provide the following assets:

### App Icons
- StoreLogo.png (50x50 px)
- Square44x44Logo.png (44x44 px)
- Square150x150Logo.png (150x150 px)
- Wide310x150Logo.png (310x150 px)
- LargeTile.png (310x310 px)

### Splash Screen
- SplashScreen.png (620x300 px)

These assets should be placed in the `Assets/Icons` folder.

## Placeholder Assets

The application will work without custom icons using the default Windows icons. Add custom icons later for a branded experience.
